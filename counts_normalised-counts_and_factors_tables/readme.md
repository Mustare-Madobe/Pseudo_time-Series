# Results, counts, normalised counts and table of factors used for analysis

### Presenting the "Pseudo-time-series" Concept

We have crafted a detailed slideshow to present the concept of "Pseudo-time-series" with clarity and precision. Through a well-organized sequence of graphs and images, we aim to illustrate the evolving narrative of our data, making this complex concept accessible and understandable.

### Directory Overview

Our directory is a comprehensive repository storing a variety of intermediate data products. As we delved deeper into our analysis, we continually enhanced our count matrix with additional supplementary data. This repository is enriched with:

* Counts
* Normalized counts
* Factors tables
* Other essential raw materials crucial for graph analysis
