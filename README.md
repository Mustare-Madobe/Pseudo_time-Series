# Pseudo-time-series seedling establishment in microgravity with and without light

**MATRIX-V5 Plant AWG meta-analysis** This repo contains data products produced while exploring a series of studies with similar meta-data characteristics Arabidopsis as the species, Flight vs Ground as the Treatment, RNAseq as the assay type, no fraction G forces or additional radiation treatments.

**Keywords:** Spaceflight, Arabidopsis, RNAseq, meta-analysis, plant genetics, hypoxia, Reactive Oxygen Species(ROS), nitric oxide (NO), The N-end rule pathway of ubiquitin-mediated targeted proteolysis, N-degron pathways, protein degradation, proteostasis, oxygen, termination, seedling, time-series.

**Introductory/Summary:** Overall, these accessions from the GeneLab data repository provide invaluable data for understanding the complex dynamics of Arabidopsis thaliana development under varied environmental conditions, particularly focusing on the effects of microgravity and light on different genotypes, ages, and tissues. Spaceflight presents a unique environment for biological experiments, notably due to the presence of microgravity and other space-specific factors. Understanding how plants respond to these conditions is crucial for long-term space missions and offers insights into fundamental biological processes. Arabidopsis, a widely used model organism in plant biology, has been the focus of numerous studies to explore plant growth and development in space. The selection of these 5 GLDS datasets, comprising 38 observations across 8 variables, provides a comprehensive overview of various Arabidopsis seedling development experiments conducted during spaceflight.

**Importance of seed germination for seedling establishment and its influence on the life cycle**

Seed germination is a crucial stage in the life cycle of plants, marking the transition from a dormant seed to an actively growing seedling. This process is essential for seedling establishment and subsequent plant growth, as it determines the vigour and overall health of the plant. The importance of seed germination extends beyond the initial stages of plant development, as it also influences the plant's reproductive success and ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In this essay, we will explore the significance of seed germination for seedling establishment and its impact on the life cycle of plants. We will examine the role of germination in determining seedling vigour and subsequent plant growth, as well as its influence on the overall reproductive success and adaptation strategies of plants.

**Microgravity and its effects on seedling establishment**

Microgravity, also known as weightlessness, is a unique environment characterized by the absence of gravity or a gravitational field that is significantly weaker than that of Earth. This condition can be achieved through various means, such as spaceflight, parabolic flights, or drop towers. Plants exposed to microgravity experience a range of physiological and developmental changes compared to their counterparts grown in normal gravity conditions. This introductory paragraph provides an overview of microgravity, its effects on plant growth and development, and specific effects on seed germination, including the influence of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) during the germination process.

**Objectives of this essay/paper plan**

The exploration of space presents unique challenges and opportunities for plant growth and agriculture. Understanding the fundamental processes of seed germination and their regulation in microgravity environments is crucial for the success of future space missions and the establishment of sustainable food production systems beyond Earth. This essay aims to examine the stages of seed germination and their hormonal regulation, compare seed germination in microgravity and ground controls, investigate the effects of light on seed germination in microgravity, and discuss the implications of these findings for space agriculture and future research. By gaining insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying seed germination in microgravity, we can develop strategies to optimize plant growth and crop production in space, ensuring the long-term sustainability of human space exploration and the potential for off-world agriculture
